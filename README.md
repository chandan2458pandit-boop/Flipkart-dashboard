Power BI dashboards, organized sequentially as if they were different pages of a report.

Page 1: Key Performance Indicators (Main Dashboard)
This page appears to be the main or executive summary dashboard, providing a high-level overview of the entire business.

Key Metrics (KPIs): The top row showcases the most critical metrics:

Total Orders: 50K

Total Sales: $113.58M

Average Order: $2.27K

On-Time Delivery %: 70%

Best ROAS: 10.70

Avg Rating %: 4.05

Main Visuals:

Delivery Status: A horizontal bar chart showing the breakdown of deliveries by status: On-Time (80M, likely a large number of orders, not monetary value), Slightly Delayed (23M), and Significantly Delayed. This gives a quick view of logistical efficiency.

Sentiment Split: A donut chart illustrating the distribution of customer feedback sentiment: Positive (13K, 16%), Neutral (23K, 28%), and Negative (46K, 56%). Note: The numbers and percentages seem mismatched. The chart shows Negative as the largest category, which is a significant finding. This indicates a major issue with customer satisfaction that needs immediate attention.

Payment Method: A donut chart showing the split of orders by payment method: Card, Cash, Wallet, and UPI. The distribution is remarkably even, with each method contributing 25% of the total payments (28M each), suggesting a balanced payment ecosystem.

Sales Trend: A line chart tracking sales over time on a monthly basis. This allows users to see the seasonal trends and identify peaks (like in February and May) and dips (like in March).

Top 10 Product Sales: A table listing the top-performing products by Total Orders and Total Sales. For example, one product has 5427 total orders and $13,388,958.23 in sales, clearly a top revenue generator. This is crucial for inventory and marketing decisions.

Page 2: Orders & Sales Details
This dashboard dives deeper into the sales and revenue data.

Key Metrics (KPIs):

Total Revenue: $113.58M (consistent with Page 1)

Repeat Customers %: 69% (a high percentage, indicating strong customer loyalty)

Sales of Monthly: A line chart showing monthly sales trends. This is a more detailed version of the "Sales Trend" from the previous page, showing specific values for each month (e.g., $9.9M in January, a dip to $8.7M in February).

Total Orders: A bar chart showing total orders distributed across different, unreadable categories (likely store or product IDs). This helps identify where the bulk of the orders are coming from.

Sales of Category: A horizontal bar chart ranking product categories by total sales. It shows that Baby Care is the top-selling category ($91M), followed by Fruits & Vegetables ($87M), and Household Care ($86M). This insight is vital for category management.

Sales of Product Name: A donut chart showing the sales contribution of the top products. The largest slices are laborae quaerat (20.5%), quas teneture (20.4%), aliquam quisq... (19.45%), and sapiente quos (19.3%). This shows a healthy mix of top-selling items rather than reliance on a single product.

Page 3: Delivery Performance

Key Metrics (KPIs):

On-Time Delivery %: 70% (consistent with Page 1)

Average Delivery Time: 4.37 hours

Average Distance: 2.75 km

Delayed %: 30%

Main Visuals:

Delivery Trend Over Time: A line chart showing the monthly on-time delivery percentage, which fluctuates throughout the year. It highlights periods of better (e.g., April) and worse (e.g., August) performance.

Delivery Performance by Store: A stacked bar chart that shows the performance of different stores based on their delivery status. This is critical for identifying which stores are bottlenecks and which are performing well. For example, one store has a very high number of on-time deliveries (~46K).

Delivery Status Split: A donut chart that visualizes the overall breakdown of deliveries: On Time (68.32%), Slightly Delayed (20.51%), and Significantly Delayed (11.17%). This provides a clear, actionable view of the delivery service's reliability.

Page 4: Customer Feedback Analysis
This dashboard focuses on understanding customer satisfaction and feedback.

Key Metrics (KPIs):

Avg Rating %: 4.05 (consistent with Page 1)

Positive Feedback %: 70%

Negative Feedback %: 10%

Top Complaint Count: 13K

Main Visuals:

Avg Rating by Area: A map of the world, with clusters of data points concentrated heavily in India. This visualizes the geographical distribution of customer feedback and ratings, which could be used to identify regional trends or issues.

Feedback Category: A horizontal bar chart showing the volume of feedback by category. The top categories are Delivery, App Experience, Product Quality, and Customer Service, all with very high and similar volumes. This indicates that these are the most common areas of feedback for Flipkart and where the company should focus its improvement efforts.

Sentiment: A donut chart showing the overall sentiment split of feedback: Positive (70.56%), Neutral (18.96%), and Negative (10.48%). This shows a predominantly positive customer base, despite the high number of complaints mentioned in the KPI and the sentiment split on Page 1. The discrepancy between the two dashboards (Page 1 showing 56% negative, this page showing 10.48%) suggests a potential data inconsistency or different data sources being used for the two analyses.
